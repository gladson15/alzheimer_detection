# Alzheimer's Detection and Age Prediction

An AI-powered web application that helps detect Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI scans and predicts the patient's age.

## Live Demo
The application is deployed and accessible at: [Alzheimer's Detection App](https://alzheimerdetection-khigjvzkh4kiruke8ctjbd.streamlit.app/)

## Features
- Upload and analyze brain MRI scans
- Real-time Alzheimer's disease detection
- Age prediction from brain MRI images
- User-friendly Streamlit interface

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Streamlit for web interface
- PyTorch for deep learning models
- Computer Vision for image processing

## Model Information
The application uses a trained deep learning model (`alzeimer_best_model.pth`) to analyze brain MRI scans and make predictions.

## Usage
1. Visit the [live application](https://alzheimerdetection-khigjvzkh4kiruke8ctjbd.streamlit.app/)
2. Upload a brain MRI scan image
3. Wait for the analysis to complete
4. View the detection results and age prediction
